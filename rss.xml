            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>To Be Or Not To Be</h1><p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4d2b70ebda1ee36fae42e6f6c18cab68/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=1116&cropwidth=1702&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fada4190e-403e-46cc-834c-680bfbf429ba.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>BioLite PowerLight Mini</h1><p>BioLite became leaders in the cooking and charging market thanks to their nifty wood burning CampStove (with portable grill) that generates electricity. For 2016, they now offer a lighter, battery-powered version called the CookStove for those who want an easy-to-start campfire but don't need the added perk of device-charging.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/13631fc3e6fbe9f55d022f5d64527ea880084592.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Colorado's Woody Creek Distillers</h1><p>Only last week a panel of expert judges convened for the annual San Francisco World Spirits Competition-arguably the most prestigious and analytical booze assembling in the States. While the complete results won't be formally announced until 4 April, it's already known that Colorado's independently owned Woody Creek Distillers (located just a 20-minute drive from downtown Aspen) won double gold for one of their newer releases: a tasty small-batch Colorado Straight Rye.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b64dca9b02fd08fb329890c39fa2430abff82993.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sevenhugs' Smart Remote</h1><p>Looking to simplify the endless number of apps and interfaces used to control smart-home products, French start-up Sevenhugs has introduced the first "contextually aware" universal Smart Remote. In other words, it's the first remote to understand where it is in your home and what it's pointing at, allowing users to simply point and click to control devices instead of switching between apps.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df1caa77bd36920224edf22d445e863c5b829e80.jpg"></article>]]></description>
